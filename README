This is a normal ERC 20 token intended for treasuries, DAOs, etc.. The treasury
should deploy it and mint itself the initial amount. It should also designate
different accounts for additional minting and burning afterwards.

The token is split into 3 files, the core of the contract being main.cairo. You
can just compile that one to get the contract:

$ starknet-compile main.cairo

Happy hunting.
